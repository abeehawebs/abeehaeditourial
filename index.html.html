 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"> A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions</font></center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><br>
 <center>stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules,</center> <br>
 <center>produce information (output), and store the information for future use.</center><br>
 <center>Any kind of computers consists of HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.</center></font><br><br>

 <center> <h4><font face="Aharoni" size="4">1. VACCUM TUBE</font></h4><br></center>
 <center><img src="C:\Users\inabiyah\Desktop\new\images\vacum.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="IMAGE OF VACCUM TUBE"></center><br>
 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"> VACCUM TUBE is used in first generation of ComputerAlternatively called an electron</font></center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><br>
 <center>tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904. The vacuum tube is a glass tube</center><br>
 <center>with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron </center><br>
<center> flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. The picture shows a collection of</center><br>
 <center>different vacuum tubes used with different devices.</center><br>
<center> <h5><font face="Aharoni" size="4">FAILURES</font></h5></center><br>
 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><center>Vacuum tubes may develop defects in operation that make an individual tube </center><br>
 <center>unsuitable in a given device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application.</center><br>
 <center>Microphonics refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way;</center><br>
<center> sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path (with greater than unity gain)</center><br>
 <center>develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple</center><br>
 <center>into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from the ends of the heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due </center><br>
 <center>to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use,</center><br>
 <center>although unobjectionable for other purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications </center><br>
 <center>can produce better results.</center><br>
<center>Tube pins can develop non-conducting or high resistance surface films due to heat or dirt.</center><br>
 <center>Pins can be cleaned to restore conductance.</center><br>
 
 
 <h6><font face="Aharoni" size="4">2. TRANSISTOR</font></h6><br>
 <center><img src="C:\Users\inabiyah\Desktop\new\images/tr.png" width="200" height="150" alt="IMAGE OF TRANSISTOR"></center><br>
 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><center>TRANSISTOR are used in second generation of Computer.A transistor is a miniature</center><br>
<center> semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition amplifying </center><br>
 <center>and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch/gate for them. </center><br>
 <center>Typically, transistors consist of three layers, or terminals, of a semiconductor material, each of which can carry a current.</center><br>
 <h6><font face="Aharoni" size="4">FAILURES</font><h6><font face="Aharoni" size="4"></font><br><br>
 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><center>The main thing that damages transistors is overheating. Don't drive it too hard. </center><br>
 <center>Fancier transistors (FETs etc) can be damaged by erosion. If you over-drive them (too much current or heat) </center><br>
 <center>then you can gradually damage them.</center><br>
 
 
 <center> <h4><font face="Aharoni" size="4">3. INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (ICs)</font></h4><br></center>
 <img src="C:\Users\inabiyah\Desktop\new\images\bb.png"width="300" height="100"><br><br>
 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><center>An integrated circuit (IC), sometimes called a chip, microchip or microelectronic circuit, is</center><br>
<center> a semiconductor wafer on which thousands or millions of tiny resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors are fabricated.ntegrated circuits</center><br>
 <center>are a combination of diodes, microprocessors, and transistors in a minimized form on a wafer made of silicon. Each of these components has a</center><br>
 <center>specific function. These can perform calculations and multiple tasks when combined with each other.</center><br>
 <center> <h5><font face="Aharoni" size="4">FAILURES</font></h5></center><br>
 <center>ICs fail due to several factors. The most frequent causes of IC failure can be categorised under manufacturing defects, physical damage to the packaging, harsh/center><br></center>
 <center>operating temperature conditions, and electrostatic discharge (ESD).<br></center><br><br>
 
 
 
 <center> <h4><font face="Aharoni" size="4">3. MICROPROCESSOR </font></h4><br></center>
 <img src="C:\Users\inabiyah\Desktop\new\images\mi.jpg"width="200" height="150"><br><br>
 <center><font face="Rockwell" size="4"><center>A microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a</center><br>
<center> single integrated circuit, or a small number of integrated circuits. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry </center><br>
 <center>required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit.</center><br>
 <center>Some of the common components of a microprocessor are: </center><br>
 <center>Control Unit. </center><br>
 <center>I/O Units.</center><br>
 <center>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</center><br>
 <center>   <h6><font face="Aharoni" size="4">FAILURES</font><h6><font face="Aharoni" size="4"></font><br></center>
	<center>One of the most common signs of CPU failure is the random freezing of your computer, usually after just logging into the operating system. The system won't </center><br>
	<center>respond to any of your instructions. The mouse freezes on the screen and any attempt to use the keyboard will</center><br>
	<center>result in a series of short beeps.</center><br>
